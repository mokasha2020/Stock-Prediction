# Stock-Prediction
Python code to predict a stock price using Yahoo Finance lib. This code is cloned from VikParuchuri but we want to make some modifications to it. 
Here is a list of the modifications that we will attempt to make  


## Improve the algorithm  

Run with a reduced step size! This will take longer, but increase accuracy  

Try discarding older data (only keeping data in a certain window)  

Try a different machine learning algorithm  

Tweak random forest parameters, or the prediction threshold  

## Add in more predictors  

Account for activity post-close and pre-open  

Interest rates   

Analyst ratings  

Prices of related stocks
