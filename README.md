# Stock-Prediction
Python code to predict a stock price using Yahoo Finance lib. This code is cloned from VikParuchuri but we want to make some modifications to it. 
Here is a list of the modifications that we will attempt to make  



## Improve the technique  

Calculate how much money you'd make if you traded with this algorithm  

## Improve the algorithm  

Run with a reduced step size! This will take longer, but increase accuracy  

Try discarding older data (only keeping data in a certain window)  

Try a different machine learning algorithm  

Tweak random forest parameters, or the prediction threshold  

## Add in more predictors  

Account for activity post-close and pre-open  

Early trading  

Trading on other exchanges that open before the NYSE (to see what the global sentiment is)  

Economic indicators  

Interest rates  

Other important economic news  

Key dates  

Dividends  

External factors like elections  

Company milestones  

Earnings calls  

Analyst ratings  

Major announcements  

Prices of related stocks  

Other companies in the same sector  

Key partners, customers, etc.
