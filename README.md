# Stock-Prediction
Python code to predict a stock price using Yahoo Finance lib. This code is cloned from VikParuchuri but we want to make some modifications to it. 
Here is a list of the modifications that we will attempt to make

Improve the technique
Calculate how much money you'd make if you traded with this algorithm
Improve the algorithm
Run with a reduced step size! This will take longer, but increase accuracy
Try discarding older data (only keeping data in a certain window)
Try a different machine learning algorithm
Tweak random forest parameters, or the prediction threshold
Add in more predictors
Account for activity post-close and pre-open
Early trading
Trading on other exchanges that open before the NYSE (to see what the global sentiment is)
Economic indicators
Interest rates
Other important economic news
Key dates
Dividends
External factors like elections
Company milestones
Earnings calls
Analyst ratings
Major announcements
Prices of related stocks
Other companies in the same sector
Key partners, customers, etc.
